# Particle Swarm Optimization based Target Search
Over the years, multiple algorithms have beenput forward and have proven to be viable for the path planning of each of thenodes in these multi-robot systems, in an efficient manner given various con-straints, and while allowing for decentralized communication mechanisms, andbalancing efficiency, exploration, and exploitation with varying number of robots.Some examples include Genetic algorithms, Bee Colony Optimization, Differen-tial Evolution, Gravitational Search, Bat algorithm, and particle swarm optimization.
